# Changelog

## [1.5.4] - 13-05-2026

- Added: `serviceAccount.automountServiceAccountToken` (default `false`) on Deployment and CronJob templates so workloads no longer mount a Kubernetes API token by default.
- Added: dedicated projected ServiceAccount token volume for the OpenBao agent sidecar (configurable via `openbao.serviceAccountToken.volumeName` / `expirationSeconds`) so OpenBao injection continues to work when `automountServiceAccountToken: false`. The token volume is not mounted into application containers.

## [1.5.3] - 06-05-2026

- Fixed: PDB resource affected all Pods with label name. Even CronJobs.
